This week, we read *Training Deep Neural Networks*, Chapter 5 of the textbook.
This chapter outlines some of the fundamental problems in training deep neural
networks, like the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. This chapter gave
us a good intuition why training all layers at the same speed is difficult,
and why deep learning is an **engineering science**.

We also read [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/),
Andrej Karpathy's blog post. This gives some practical advice for getting
deep neural networks to train well: to converge quickly to good solutions.
