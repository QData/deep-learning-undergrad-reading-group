This week, we had two presentations: GANs (presented by Alan Zheng) and Style
Transfer (presented by Jack Morris). We thought that the GANs paper was as
good of a place as any for us to begin in terms of academic papers. It doesn't
get more fundamental than this. The original GANs paper outlines the novel
setup of a GAN as a minimax game between a generator and discriminator. It
contains some theory, which is complicated, but approachable (even for us!),
as well as some really interesting applications-- showing the **amazing**
results you get when you sample from the latent space of a gan (generating
new MNIST digits and pictures of faces).

Finally, just for kicks, we took a look at [https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/]
and had a group discussion about generated images, DeepFakes, and the problems
these types of systems pose in today's society.
