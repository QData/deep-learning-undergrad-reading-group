We chose this paper since YOLO is the most widely used technique in real-time object detection, which is an important application of computer vision. The paper was relatively easy to understand as one of its contributions was simplifying previous architectures while maintaining good performance. We ended with a short discussion on the ethics on computer vision, as the author of YOLO has now stopped doing CV research.
