We chose this paper since it kicked off a revolution in NLP architectures, introducing attention-based transformers.
While the paper provided a good technical approach, it didn't have the best visualizations to help us understand how transformers worked. We looked at [The Illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer).
