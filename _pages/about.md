We are part of the QData lab at the University of Virginia under [Professor Yanjun Qi](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/yanjun/). We noticed a lack of helpful online resources for undergraduates getting started in deep learning research and decided to forge our own path. We meet weekly to discuss an interesting research paper selected from a range of topics, from general deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

**UVA Students**: Please reach out to [Jack Morris](mailto:jm8wx@virginia.edu) if you're interested in joining the group. We welcome new members regardless of experience level. We're happy to point you to resources to help you get up to speed.
